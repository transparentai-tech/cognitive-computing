# SPA Examples Testing Summary

## Overview
The SPA examples were created based on a conceptual API that differs from the actual implementation. While all syntax errors have been fixed, the examples need significant updates to work with the actual SPA implementation.

## Testing Results

### 1. basic_spa_demo.py
- **Status**: Syntax fixed, but uses non-existent methods
- **Issues**: 
  - Uses methods like `update_working_memory()` that don't exist in CognitiveControl
  - Lambda effects in Action objects need proper implementation
  
### 2. cognitive_control.py  
- **Status**: Syntax fixed, initialization corrected
- **Issues**:
  - CognitiveControl API mismatch - many methods used don't exist
  - Working memory management methods need to be implemented differently
  
### 3. production_system.py
- **Status**: Syntax fixed
- **Issues**:
  - Condition() constructor usage is incorrect - should use MatchCondition or CompareCondition
  - Effect() constructor pattern needs updating
  
### 4. question_answering.py
- **Status**: Syntax fixed
- **Issues**:
  - KnowledgeBase class implementation needed
  - Memory recall patterns need adjustment
  
### 5. sequential_behavior.py
- **Status**: Syntax fixed  
- **Issues**:
  - Sequencing class methods may not match implementation
  - State transitions need verification
  
### 6. neural_implementation.py
- **Status**: Syntax fixed
- **Issues**:
  - Neural components (Ensemble, EnsembleArray) need verification
  - Connection patterns may differ from implementation

## Working Example
Created `simple_spa_demo.py` which demonstrates the actual SPA API and runs successfully:
- Vocabulary creation and semantic pointer operations
- Memory storage and retrieval
- Basic action selection
- Module creation and usage

## Recommendations
1. Update all examples to use the actual SPA API
2. Create intermediate examples that bridge the gap between simple and complex usage
3. Add error handling and validation
4. Document the actual API vs conceptual API differences
5. Consider implementing missing functionality if it's essential for SPA

## Next Steps
1. Gradually update each example to work with actual implementation
2. Create unit tests for example functionality
3. Document the real API with clear examples
4. Consider extending the SPA implementation to support the conceptual API if beneficial
