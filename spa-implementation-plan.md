# Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) Implementation Plan

This document provides a comprehensive implementation plan for adding Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) to the cognitive-computing package, following the established patterns from SDM, HRR, VSA, and HDC implementations.

## Executive Summary

SPA represents a cognitive architecture that extends HRR with structured control flow, action selection, and neural implementation principles. As the natural next step after HRR, SPA provides:
- Semantic pointers for symbol-like processing with neural grounding
- Action selection through basal ganglia-inspired mechanisms
- Cognitive control via thalamus-like routing
- Production system capabilities with vector representations
- Integration of multiple cognitive modules

## Implementation Overview

### Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Core infrastructure and base classes
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-4): Neural modules and action selection
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 5-6): Production systems and cognitive control
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 7-8): Model builder and high-level API
- **Phase 5** (Weeks 9-10): Advanced features and optimizations
- **Phase 6** (Weeks 11-12): Testing completion, documentation, and examples

### Test Coverage Goals
- **Target**: 200+ tests across 8-9 test files
- **Coverage**: >95% code coverage
- **Test Types**: Unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks
- **Markers**: slow, benchmark, integration, gpu (optional)
