# HDC Theory and Mathematical Foundations

## Mathematical Framework

### Vector Space Properties

Hyperdimensional Computing operates in vector spaces with the following properties:

1. **High Dimensionality**: Vectors in ℝᵈ or {0,1}ᵈ where d ∈ [1000, 10000]
2. **Distance Preservation**: Operations preserve meaningful distance relationships
3. **Concentration of Measure**: Most random vectors are nearly equidistant

### Fundamental Operations

#### 1. Binding Operation (⊗)

The binding operation creates a new hypervector that is dissimilar to both operands:

**Binary Binding (XOR)**:
```
c = a ⊗ b
cᵢ = aᵢ ⊕ bᵢ  (XOR operation)
```

**Bipolar Binding (Multiplication)**:
```
c = a ⊗ b
cᵢ = aᵢ × bᵢ  where aᵢ, bᵢ ∈ {-1, +1}
```

Properties:
- Self-inverse: a ⊗ b ⊗ b = a
- Commutative: a ⊗ b = b ⊗ a
- Associative: (a ⊗ b) ⊗ c = a ⊗ (b ⊗ c)
- Distributes over bundling: a ⊗ (b + c) ≈ (a ⊗ b) + (a ⊗ c)

#### 2. Bundling Operation (+)

The bundling operation creates a hypervector similar to all inputs:

**Binary Bundling (Majority)**:
```
s = a + b + c
sᵢ = majority(aᵢ, bᵢ, cᵢ)
```

**Bipolar Bundling (Normalized Sum)**:
```
s = a + b + c
sᵢ = sign(aᵢ + bᵢ + cᵢ)
```

Properties:
- Commutative: a + b = b + a
- Associative: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
- Similar to all inputs: δ(s, a) < δ(random, a)

#### 3. Permutation Operation (ρ)

Permutation creates a dissimilar vector while preserving structure:

```
p = ρ(a)
pᵢ = a_{(i+k) mod d}  (cyclic shift by k)
```

Properties:
- Invertible: ρ⁻¹(ρ(a)) = a
- Preserves distances: δ(a, b) = δ(ρ(a), ρ(b))
- Non-commutative with binding: ρ(a ⊗ b) ≠ ρ(a) ⊗ ρ(b)

### Similarity Measures

#### Hamming Distance (Binary)
```
δₕ(a, b) = Σᵢ |aᵢ - bᵢ| / d
```

#### Cosine Similarity (Bipolar)
```
cos(a, b) = (a · b) / (||a|| ||b||)
```

For bipolar vectors with ||a|| = ||b|| = √d:
```
cos(a, b) = (a · b) / d
```

## Information Capacity

### Storage Capacity

The number of items that can be stored with reliable retrieval:

**Binary Vectors**:
```
C ≈ 0.15 × d / log₂(d)
```

**Bipolar Vectors**:
```
C ≈ 0.20 × d / log₂(d)
```

Where d is the dimension and retrieval accuracy > 99%.

### Noise Tolerance

Probability of correct retrieval with noise level η:

```
P(correct) = Φ((1 - 2η)√d / 2)
```

Where Φ is the cumulative normal distribution function.

## Encoding Schemes

### Level Quantization

For scalar values v ∈ [vₘᵢₙ, vₘₐₓ] with L levels:

```
level(v) = ⌊L × (v - vₘᵢₙ) / (vₘₐₓ - vₘᵢₙ)⌋
hv(v) = H[level(v)]
```

Where H is a codebook of L orthogonal hypervectors.

### Thermometer Encoding

```
hv(v)ᵢ = {
  1 if i < t × d
  0 otherwise
}
```

Where t = (v - vₘᵢₙ) / (vₘₐₓ - vₘᵢₙ) is the normalized value.

### Sequence Encoding

**N-gram encoding**:
```
hv(s) = Σᵢ bind(hv(sᵢ), ρⁱ(hv(sᵢ₊₁)), ..., ρⁿ⁻¹(hv(sᵢ₊ₙ₋₁)))
```

**Positional encoding**:
```
hv(s) = Σᵢ bind(hv(sᵢ), posᵢ)
```

## Theoretical Foundations

### Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma

For any set of n points in high-dimensional space, there exists a linear map to O(log n / ε²) dimensions that preserves distances within (1 ± ε).

Application to HDC: Ensures that high-dimensional operations preserve meaningful relationships.

### Blessing of Dimensionality

In high dimensions:
1. Random vectors are nearly orthogonal
2. Space is vast enough to represent many concepts
3. Local neighborhoods become meaningful

### Holographic Reduced Representations

HDC implements holographic storage where:
- Information is distributed across all dimensions
- Each dimension contains partial information about the whole
- Robust to component failures

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

| Operation | Binary | Bipolar |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Generate | O(d) | O(d) |
| Bind | O(d) | O(d) |
| Bundle | O(nd) | O(nd) |
| Similarity | O(d) | O(d) |

Where n is the number of vectors to bundle.

### Space Complexity

- Storage per item: O(d) bits (binary) or O(d log L) bits (L-level)
- Associative memory with k items: O(kd)

## Convergence Properties

### Bundling Convergence

As the number of bundled vectors increases:
```
lim_{n→∞} bundle(v₁, ..., vₙ) → mean vector
```

The result converges to the centroid in the hyperdimensional space.

### Iterative Retrieval

For composite structures, iterative unbinding converges:
```
x₀ = query
xₙ₊₁ = cleanup(unbind(memory, xₙ))
```

Converges to stored item if initial similarity > threshold.

## Connections to Neuroscience

1. **Sparse Distributed Representations**: Similar to cortical representations
2. **Binding Problem**: Addresses how the brain combines features
3. **Pattern Completion**: Models associative memory in hippocampus
4. **Noise Tolerance**: Reflects robustness of biological systems
