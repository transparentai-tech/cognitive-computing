# Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) Overview

## Introduction

Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA) or Computing with High-Dimensional Vectors, is a brain-inspired computing paradigm that performs computations using high-dimensional vectors (typically 1,000-10,000 dimensions). HDC provides a unified framework for representing and manipulating various types of data—from scalars to complex data structures—using vectors in high-dimensional spaces.

## Key Concepts

### High-Dimensional Vectors (Hypervectors)

The fundamental unit in HDC is a hypervector—a vector with thousands of dimensions. These vectors exhibit several unique properties:

- **Quasi-orthogonality**: Random hypervectors are nearly orthogonal with high probability
- **Robustness**: High tolerance to noise and component failures
- **Holographic**: Information is distributed across all dimensions
- **Fixed-width**: All data types use the same vector dimensionality

### Core Operations

HDC relies on three fundamental operations:

1. **Binding (⊗)**: Combines two hypervectors to create a new hypervector that is dissimilar to both inputs
   - Binary vectors: XOR operation
   - Bipolar vectors: Element-wise multiplication
   - Creates associations between concepts

2. **Bundling (+)**: Superimposes multiple hypervectors to create a new hypervector similar to all inputs
   - Binary vectors: Majority voting
   - Bipolar vectors: Element-wise addition with sign
   - Creates sets or collections

3. **Permutation (ρ)**: Rearranges vector components to create a dissimilar but related vector
   - Used for encoding sequences and positions
   - Preserves distance relationships

### Similarity Measures

HDC uses various similarity metrics to compare hypervectors:
- **Hamming distance**: For binary vectors
- **Cosine similarity**: For real-valued vectors
- **Dot product**: Fast similarity approximation

## Architecture Components

### 1. Hypervector Types

The package supports multiple hypervector representations:

```python
from cognitive_computing.hdc import HDC, HDCConfig

# Binary hypervectors {0, 1}
binary_hdc = HDC(HDCConfig(dimension=10000, hypervector_type="binary"))

# Bipolar hypervectors {-1, +1}
bipolar_hdc = HDC(HDCConfig(dimension=10000, hypervector_type="bipolar"))

# Ternary hypervectors {-1, 0, +1}
ternary_hdc = HDC(HDCConfig(dimension=10000, hypervector_type="ternary"))

# Multi-level hypervectors
level_hdc = HDC(HDCConfig(dimension=10000, hypervector_type="level", levels=5))
```

### 2. Data Encoders

HDC provides encoders to convert various data types into hypervectors:

- **ScalarEncoder**: Continuous values using thermometer or level encoding
- **CategoricalEncoder**: Discrete categories with orthogonal hypervectors
- **SequenceEncoder**: Ordered sequences using n-grams or positional encoding
- **SpatialEncoder**: 2D/3D coordinates preserving spatial relationships
- **RecordEncoder**: Structured data with field-value bindings
- **NGramEncoder**: Text data using character or word n-grams

### 3. Associative Memory

The ItemMemory class provides content-addressable storage:

```python
from cognitive_computing.hdc import ItemMemory

memory = ItemMemory(dimension=10000)
memory.add("apple", apple_vector)
memory.add("banana", banana_vector)

# Query with noisy vector
results = memory.query(noisy_apple, top_k=3)
cleaned, label = memory.cleanup(noisy_apple)
```

### 4. HDC Classifiers

Several classification algorithms leverage HDC principles:

- **OneShotClassifier**: Learn from single examples
- **AdaptiveClassifier**: Online learning with momentum
- **EnsembleClassifier**: Combine multiple classifiers
- **HierarchicalClassifier**: Multi-level classification

## Applications

HDC is particularly well-suited for:

1. **Cognitive Computing**: Modeling human-like reasoning and memory
2. **Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from multiple sensors
3. **Natural Language Processing**: Semantic representation of text
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Robust classification with few examples
5. **Edge Computing**: Efficient computation on resource-constrained devices
6. **Fault-Tolerant Systems**: Graceful degradation with component failures

## Advantages

- **Efficiency**: Simple operations (XOR, addition) suitable for hardware
- **Robustness**: Tolerates noise and hardware faults
- **Scalability**: Fixed-width representations for all data types
- **Interpretability**: Similarity measures provide semantic meaning
- **One-shot Learning**: Learn from single examples
- **Compositionality**: Complex structures from simple operations

## Getting Started

```python
from cognitive_computing.hdc import HDC, HDCConfig, ItemMemory

# Create HDC system
config = HDCConfig(dimension=10000, hypervector_type="bipolar")
hdc = HDC(config)

# Generate hypervectors
fruit = hdc.generate_hypervector()
red = hdc.generate_hypervector()
sweet = hdc.generate_hypervector()

# Create composite concept
apple = hdc.bind(fruit, hdc.bind(red, sweet))

# Bundle similar items
banana = hdc.bind(fruit, hdc.bind(yellow, sweet))
fruits = hdc.bundle([apple, banana])

# Store in memory
memory = ItemMemory(dimension=10000)
memory.add("apple", apple)
memory.add("fruits", fruits)

# Query with properties
red_fruit = hdc.bind(red, fruit)
results = memory.query(red_fruit, top_k=2)
```
